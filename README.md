# Business_Insights_360

## Intro
AtliQ, a rapidly growing hardware company, serves a diverse range of customers globally üåç. However, in recent years, the company has faced financial setbacks due to a lack of deep insights into its operations. To address this challenge, the data analytics team was tasked with transforming raw data into meaningful insights through dynamic and insightful dashboards, paving the way for data-driven decision-making. This is where I had the opportunity to contribute, developing the Business Insights 360 dashboard to assist AtliQ in turning data into action. üöÄ
